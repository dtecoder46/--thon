# Overview
This is a programming language made in Python, which is based on Python but replaces some symbols and functions with single Greek letters.

# Note
For this to work if your code is multiple lines, you must put a newline character (ν) at the start of each line after the first line. To make nested lines, you must make an indent (Ι) at the start of each nested line.
